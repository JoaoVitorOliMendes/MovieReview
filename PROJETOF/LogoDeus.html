    <h1 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 10%;font-size: 4vw;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-style: italic;">God and His languages</h1>
    <p class="p">
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGod is a very personal subject, each one has their own definition and beliefs, the important is to respect and have an open mind about the topic.</p>
        <p class="p">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor Logosophy God is the Creator, He created everything with much love and perfection, the nature, the universe, the Universal Laws, us and everything beyond are examples of creation. Even though all these examples were created billions of years ago until today God communicates with us.</p>
        <p class="p">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom the book <i><b>“Bases for your Conduct”</b></i>: <i><b>“Don't settle for just knowing that God exists. You must feel Him through conscious manifestations of your own spirit;”</b></i> . God is present in all His creation, it’s only up to you to notice his messages. For example when you feel very tired and stressed out, then suddenly you see the most beautiful sunset, feeling much better, you realize that is God sending you a message, making you learn to be grateful and relax.</p>
        <p class="p">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnother way to recognize His messages is seeing how much we  learn from nature itself, from the book <i><b>“Tomos 1”</b></i>: <i><b>“Nature is wise and contains the nectar of Wisdom. It is the first master of the human kind ”</b></i>. An example of nature teaching us is the plane, who has the shape of the birds, or the organization of the bees, everyone has a job that helps the survival of the community.</p>
        <p class="p">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom there we can realize that God wants us to evolve above all things, and tries to remember us of this primordial objective constantly, paying attention to what our spirit is feeling and knowing our Creator and ourselves is just the first step to learn his language and have the urge to be better.</p>
